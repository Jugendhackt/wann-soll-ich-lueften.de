Hello everyone!
I wanted to tell you that I had to shut down the servers for wann-soll-l端ften.de. I can't pay the server costs at the moment. We think that the website will be back online in 2-3 months. I am very sorry that I had to take this step. But at the moment there is no other way. Nevertheless, we will continue to work and update when-soll-ich-l端ften.de. I will notify you when the servers are up and running again.

Thanks!
Luis Schuimer and the rest of the team

WebApp suggesting the best time to vent your apartment

In what situations should I ventilate? This question is often asked. We have the answer! Our website has its own scale and more than 11,000 stations worldwide to provide you with the air quality of your city and answer the question of whether it is good to ventilate. Our scale consists of 10, 8 or 6 Points to make it easy for you to use it.

# Our Goal
The goal of this project was to visualize the air quality in a room and to find the right time of day when it is low. We built an interface that shows the current air quality to give you the optimal time for l端ften.

# Our Technology
wann-soll-ich-l端ften.de is an open source program which helps you with your search for the perfect time open your windows and to get fresh air again. Our program has been written in HTML, JavaScript, Python and Bootstrap and connects with our server which only uses the data we need.
